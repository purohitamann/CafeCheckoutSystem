## Getting Started

Cafe Checkout System is part of my Semester 02 individual project. it uses Java along with all the required technologies such as, Random Access File, File I/O, JavaFx, ArrayList. the project creates a payment system for a cafe, with Login credential set-up and verfication. User can even view past transaction details.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
